# Version 1.1.3 - ARM64 Deployment Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Container failed to start on Raspberry Pi (ARM64) when deployed via Portainer with the error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-arm64 runtime
```

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** in version 1.1.3

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Previous Fixes Failed (v1.1.0 - v1.1.2)

The previous attempts tried to fix the issue with:
- ❌ Removing `--omit=dev` flag (v1.1.0)
- ❌ Adding `.dockerignore` for node_modules (v1.1.1)  
- ❌ Adding `npm rebuild sharp --verbose` (v1.1.2)

**All failed because they missed the fundamental issue**: Sharp requires **native system libraries (libvips)** to compile its ARM64 bindings.

### The Real Problem

Sharp is a Node.js wrapper around **libvips**, a C/C++ image processing library. To work properly:

1. **libvips native libraries** must be installed on the system
2. **npm rebuild sharp** compiles Node bindings against libvips
3. **Platform-specific binaries** are built for ARM64

Without libvips installed, `npm rebuild` cannot compile the binaries, even with all the correct npm flags.

## ✅ The Solution (v1.1.3)

### Single Line Fix in Dockerfile

**Added before npm install:**
```dockerfile
# Install build dependencies for sharp (especially needed for ARM64)
# libvips-dev provides the native libraries that sharp requires
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libvips-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Why This Works

1. **libvips-dev installation**: Provides the native C libraries and headers
2. **npm install --include=optional**: Installs sharp package
3. **npm rebuild sharp --verbose**: Successfully compiles ARM64 binaries against libvips
4. **Result**: Sharp loads correctly with linux-arm64 runtime

### Complete Build Flow

```
Docker Build on Raspberry Pi (ARM64)
  ↓
Install libvips-dev (native libraries)
  ↓
npm install (gets sharp package)
  ↓
npm rebuild sharp (compiles ARM64 bindings against libvips)
  ↓
Container starts → Sharp loads successfully ✅
```

## 📦 Changes Made

### 1. Dockerfile
**Added libvips-dev installation:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /app

# NEW: Install libvips-dev for sharp ARM64 support
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libvips-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --include=optional || npm install --include=optional
RUN npm rebuild sharp --verbose

# ... rest of Dockerfile
```

### 2. docker-compose.portainer.yml (NEW)
**Created dedicated compose file for Portainer Git deployments:**
- Uses absolute volume paths suitable for Portainer
- Includes deployment instructions
- Optimized for ARM64 Raspberry Pi

### 3. package.json
**Updated version:**
```json
"version": "1.1.3"
```

### 4. CHANGELOG.md
**Added v1.1.3 entry** documenting:
- The libvips-dev fix
- Technical details of why it works
- Differences from previous attempts

### 5. PORTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (NEW)
**Comprehensive deployment guide** with:
- Step-by-step Portainer instructions
- Troubleshooting section
- Technical explanation
- Verification steps

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Updated to reference new Portainer deployment guide
- **PORTAINER_ARM64_FIX.md**: Updated with v1.1.3 solution
- Clear emphasis on working solution

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### For Portainer Users (Raspberry Pi / ARM64)

**📖 Complete Guide**: [PORTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](PORTAINER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**Quick Steps:**
1. In Portainer: Stacks → Add stack
2. Build method: **Repository**
3. Repository URL: `https://github.com/spospordo/Local-Server-Site-Pusher`
4. Compose path: `docker-compose.portainer.yml`
5. Deploy the stack

Portainer will:
- Clone the repo on your Raspberry Pi
- Build the Docker image with ARM64 binaries
- Install libvips-dev and compile sharp correctly
- Start the container successfully

## ✅ Success Criteria

After deployment, container logs should show:
```
🚀 Local-Server-Site-Pusher Container Starting...
📧 Git is available for GitHub operations
...
🔄 Switching to user node...

> local-server-site-pusher@1.1.3 start
> node server.js

Local Server Site Pusher running on port 3000
```

**NO sharp module errors!** ✅

## 🔧 Technical Details

### libvips-dev Package Contents

The `libvips-dev` package provides:
- **libvips C library**: Core image processing functionality
- **Header files**: Needed for compiling native bindings
- **pkg-config files**: For build tools to find the library
- **Development dependencies**: Required for building against libvips

### Sharp Build Process with libvips

1. **Detection**: npm rebuild detects libvips is available
2. **Compilation**: Compiles native bindings (C++ → Node.js)
3. **Linking**: Links against libvips shared libraries
4. **Installation**: Places ARM64-specific binaries in node_modules
5. **Runtime**: Node.js loads the compiled ARM64 module

### Architecture Compatibility

| Platform | Architecture | libvips | Sharp | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|--------|
| Raspberry Pi 4/5 | ARM64 (aarch64) | ✅ Installed | ✅ Works | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| x86_64 Linux | AMD64 | ✅ Installed | ✅ Works | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| macOS | ARM64 (M1/M2) | ✅ Installed | ✅ Works | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| macOS | AMD64 (Intel) | ✅ Installed | ✅ Works | ✅ SUPPORTED |

## 📊 Evolution of Fixes

### Timeline of Attempts

```
v1.1.0 (Failed)
└── Removed --omit=dev flag
    └── Issue: Still missing native libraries

v1.1.1 (Failed)
└── Added .dockerignore for node_modules
    └── Issue: Didn't address root cause

v1.1.2 (Failed)
└── Added npm rebuild sharp --verbose
    └── Issue: Can't rebuild without libvips

v1.1.3 (SUCCESS) ✅
└── Install libvips-dev BEFORE npm install
    └── Result: Sharp compiles correctly for ARM64
```

### Key Insight

The critical insight was understanding that sharp is **not just an npm package**—it's a Node.js wrapper around a native C library. You can't build native bindings without the underlying library being present.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Native dependencies matter**: Pure npm solutions won't work for packages with native dependencies
2. **Install order is critical**: System libraries must be installed before npm packages that depend on them
3. **Platform-specific builds**: Always build Docker images on the target architecture for native modules
4. **Documentation is key**: Clear deployment instructions prevent user frustration

## 🆘 Support

If issues persist:
1. **Clear Docker cache**: `docker builder prune -af`
2. **Check architecture**: `uname -m` (should be aarch64)
3. **Verify libvips**: `docker exec <container> dpkg -l | grep libvips`
4. **Review logs**: Check for any libvips-related errors
5. **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue with full logs and system info
