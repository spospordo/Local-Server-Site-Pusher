# Summary
echo "✅ All Persistence Tests Passed!"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Summary of the Fix:"
echo "   1. Added all persistent config files to .dockerignore"
echo "   2. This prevents config files from being baked into the Docker image"
echo "   3. Volume-mounted config/ directory ensures settings persist"
echo "   4. Updated documentation to list all persistent data points"
echo ""
echo "📝 What was the problem?"
echo "   - Config files were being copied INTO the Docker image during build"
echo "   - On container restart, there was confusion between image config and volume config"
echo "   - Settings could be lost or overwritten during redeploys"
echo ""
echo "✨ What's the solution?"
echo "   - .dockerignore now excludes ALL persistent config files"
echo "   - Docker image contains NO config files - they only exist in volumes"
echo "   - Volume-mounted config/ directory is the single source of truth"
echo "   - Settings now reliably persist across any container rebuild/redeploy"
echo ""
echo "🚀 To verify manually:"
echo "   1. docker-compose up -d"
echo "   2. Log in to admin interface at http://localhost:3000/admin"
echo "   3. Enable Vidiots scraper"
echo "   4. Enable GitHub upload"
echo "   5. Add Finance profile data"
echo "   6. Run: docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d"
echo "   7. Log in again - all settings should be preserved!"
