# Webcal Protocol and Weather API Testing Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Issue:** Support webcal protocol for shared calendars and persist OpenWeather key in Magic Mirror module

## Summary

This implementation adds support for the `webcal://` protocol in calendar integration and provides a comprehensive weather API testing endpoint to help users troubleshoot configuration issues.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Webcal Protocol Support ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Calendar integration displayed error `Failed to fetch calendar data: Unsupported protocol webcal:` when using webcal links from services like iCloud.

**Solution:** Automatically convert `webcal://` and `webcals://` URLs to `https://` in the calendar API endpoint.

**Implementation:**
- Modified `/api/magicmirror/calendar` endpoint in `server.js`
- Detects webcal:// and webcals:// protocols and converts them to https://
- Logs the conversion for debugging purposes
- Works transparently - users can paste webcal URLs without modification

**Code Location:** `server.js`, lines 4716-4728

**Testing:** 
```bash
# Test with webcal URL
curl http://localhost:3000/api/magicmirror/calendar
# Check logs for: "üîÑ [Magic Mirror Calendar] Converted webcal:// to https://"
```

### 2. OpenWeather API Key Persistence ‚úÖ

**Status:** Already implemented in v2.2.4

**Verification:** The Magic Mirror module uses encrypted configuration storage (`config/magicmirror-config.json.enc`) that persists across container restarts when using volume mounts.

**How it works:**
- API keys stored in encrypted format using AES-256-GCM
- Configuration updates preserve existing API key if not explicitly changed
- Volume mounting `./config:/app/config` ensures persistence

**Code Location:** `modules/magicmirror.js`, function `updateConfig()`, lines 144-180

**Testing:**
```bash
node scripts/test-webcal-weather.js
# Test 5: Magic Mirror config supports API key persistence
```

### 3. Weather API Connection Testing ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Users had difficulty troubleshooting weather widget issues (invalid API keys, incorrect location names, network problems).

**Solution:** New dedicated endpoint `/api/magicmirror/weather/test` that tests the weather API connection and provides detailed error messages.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Checks if weather widget is enabled
- ‚úÖ Validates location is configured
- ‚úÖ Verifies API key is present
- ‚úÖ Tests actual connection to OpenWeather API
- ‚úÖ Provides specific error messages for each issue
- ‚úÖ Returns detailed location information on success

**Error Messages:**

| Scenario | Error Message | Details Provided |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Widget disabled | "Weather widget not enabled" | "Enable the weather widget in Magic Mirror configuration first" |
| No location | "Location not configured" | "Please configure a location (city name) in the weather settings" |
| No API key | "API key not configured" | Link to get API key at openweathermap.org |
| Invalid API key (401) | "Invalid API key" | Verification instructions and link to API dashboard |
| Location not found (404) | "Location not found" | Suggestions for correct format ("City, Country Code") |
| Network error | "Network connection error" | Suggestions to check internet and firewall |

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Weather API connection successful",
  "details": {
    "location": "London",
    "country": "GB",
    "temperature": 22,
    "description": "clear sky",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 51.51,
      "lon": -0.13
    }
  }
}
```

**Code Location:** `server.js`, lines 4701-4808

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/magicmirror/weather/test

# Or run the test suite
node scripts/test-webcal-weather.js
```

```

## Usage Examples

### Using Webcal URLs

Before:
```
Error: Failed to fetch calendar data: Unsupported protocol webcal:
```

After:
```javascript
// Just paste the webcal URL - it works automatically!
Calendar URL: webcal://p1-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/xxx
// Automatically converted to: https://p1-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/xxx
```

### Testing Weather API

```bash
# Quick test
curl http://localhost:3000/api/magicmirror/weather/test

# Response when API key missing:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "API key not configured",
  "details": "Please configure your OpenWeather API key..."
}

# Response when location not found:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Location not found",
  "details": "The location \"Unknowncity\" could not be found..."
}

# Response on success:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Weather API connection successful",
  "details": {
    "location": "London",
    "country": "GB",
    "temperature": 22,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Workflow

### Before This Implementation
1. User configures weather widget
2. Weather doesn't show
3. User checks browser console (may not be obvious)
4. Generic error messages
5. Trial and error to fix

### After This Implementation
1. User configures weather widget
2. Weather doesn't show
3. User runs: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/magicmirror/weather/test`
4. Gets specific error: "Location not found. Try 'City, Country Code' format"
5. User fixes configuration immediately
6. Success!

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Users can add shared calendars with webcal links and events are fetched successfully
- ‚úÖ The OpenWeather API key is retained after redeploying the module or container
- ‚úÖ There is a UI or CLI method to test the weather API connection and receive detailed error messages
- ‚úÖ Documentation is updated to describe the new functionality and troubleshooting steps

## Additional Notes

### Logging
All weather test requests are logged with timestamps and client IPs:
```
üß™ [Magic Mirror Weather Test] 2025-10-13T18:05:17.942Z - Request from 127.0.0.1
üîç [Magic Mirror Weather Test] 2025-10-13T18:05:17.942Z - Testing connection with location: London
```

Calendar webcal conversion is also logged:
```
üîÑ [Magic Mirror Calendar] 2025-10-13T18:05:51.741Z - Converted webcal:// to https://
```

### Security
- API keys never exposed in logs or client responses
- Weather test endpoint requires enabled widget (prevents abuse)
- All configuration remains encrypted at rest
- No changes to existing security model

### Performance
- Webcal conversion has negligible performance impact (simple string replacement)
- Weather test endpoint makes one API call (same as normal weather fetch)
- No impact on existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Add UI button in admin panel to test weather connection
- Show test results directly in configuration interface
- Add calendar URL validation and testing
- Provide calendar format detection and suggestions
- Add rate limiting for test endpoint to prevent abuse
