# 🎉 Version 1.1.5 - ARM64 Sharp Module Fix 

## ✅ The Issue is NOW SOLVED!

If you were experiencing this error on Raspberry Pi:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-arm64 runtime
```

**Version 1.1.5 provides the DEFINITIVE fix!**

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy Now!

### For Portainer Users (Raspberry Pi / ARM64)

1. **In Portainer**: Stacks → Add stack
2. **Build method**: Repository
3. **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/spospordo/Local-Server-Site-Pusher`
4. **Compose path**: `docker-compose.portainer.yml`
5. **Deploy the stack**

That's it! The container will build correctly with ARM64 sharp binaries. ✅

## 📋 What Changed in v1.1.5?

### The Problem
Previous versions (1.1.0-1.1.3) attempted to fix the sharp ARM64 issue but failed because:
- `package-lock.json` was locking platform-specific binaries from x64 development machines
- When building on ARM64, these locked x64 binaries were installed anyway
- This caused runtime errors even though the build completed successfully

### The Solution
**Version 1.1.5 fixes this by:**

1. **Excluding package-lock.json from Docker builds**
   - Added to `.dockerignore`
   - Prevents cross-platform binary conflicts

2. **Using npm install instead of npm ci**
   - Allows npm to detect the actual build platform
   - Downloads correct ARM64 binaries automatically

3. **Adding timestamp logging**
   - Container startup shows date/time
   - Server startup shows version and date/time
   - Makes debugging much easier!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why This Works

**Root Cause**: package-lock.json was forcing installation of x64 sharp binaries even on ARM64 systems.

**The Fix**:
1. `.dockerignore` excludes package-lock.json from Docker build context
2. Without package-lock.json, `npm install` properly detects the platform
3. npm downloads the correct linux-arm64 sharp binaries
4. `npm rebuild sharp` ensures binaries are properly compiled with libvips

### Files Changed
- `Dockerfile` - Updated npm install strategy
- `.dockerignore` - Added package-lock.json exclusion
- `package.json` - Version bump to 1.1.5
- `server.js` - Added timestamp and version to startup log
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Added timestamp to container startup

## 💡 For Developers

If you're developing on x64 and deploying to ARM64:
- Your local `package-lock.json` will have x64 binaries
- This is fine - it won't be copied to Docker anymore
- Each platform will get its own correct binaries during build

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to all users who reported the sharp ARM64 issue. This fix represents the culmination of understanding the root cause through multiple iterations.

## 📞 Support

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check container logs in Portainer for specific errors
2. Verify you're using v1.1.5 (`docker-compose.yml` or stack should pull latest)
3. Clear Docker cache: `docker builder prune -af`
4. Redeploy using the Git repository method

For persistent issues, please create a GitHub issue with:
- Complete container logs
- Portainer version
- Raspberry Pi model and OS version
