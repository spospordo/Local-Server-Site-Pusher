# Version 1.1.5 - Definitive ARM64 Sharp Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue:** Sharp module continued to fail on ARM64 Raspberry Pi with error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-arm64 runtime
```

Even with previous fixes (libvips-dev installation, npm rebuild), the error persisted when deploying via Portainer.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The real culprit was **package-lock.json**:

1. **Platform Lock-in**: package-lock.json locks exact package versions AND platform-specific binaries
2. **Development vs Production Mismatch**: If package-lock.json was created on x64 (development machine), it contains references to x64-specific sharp binaries
3. **npm ci Enforcement**: When `npm ci` runs with package-lock.json, it strictly installs the locked versions, including wrong-platform binaries
4. **Runtime Failure**: Even though Docker builds on ARM64, the x64 sharp binaries are installed, causing runtime errors

## ✅ The Solution (Version 1.1.5)

### 1. Exclude package-lock.json from Docker Builds

**Added to .dockerignore:**
```
package-lock.json
```

This prevents package-lock.json from being copied into the Docker build context.

### 2. Updated Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Copy package files (package-lock.json is excluded via .dockerignore to avoid platform conflicts)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies - will use npm install since package-lock.json is excluded
# The --include=optional is critical for sharp's platform-specific binaries
# This ensures correct ARM64 binaries on Raspberry Pi
RUN npm install --include=optional

# Rebuild sharp to ensure correct platform binaries are compiled
# Essential for ARM64 Raspberry Pi deployments  
RUN npm rebuild sharp --verbose
```

**Key Changes:**
- No more `npm ci` (which requires package-lock.json)
- Uses `npm install` which detects the build platform correctly
- Rebuilds sharp after installation to guarantee ARM64 binaries

### 3. Added Timestamps to Logs

**Server startup (server.js):**
```javascript
const startTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
console.log(`[${startTime}] Local Server Site Pusher v${require('./package.json').version} running on port ${PORT}`);
```

**Container startup (docker-entrypoint.sh):**
```bash
STARTUP_TIME=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
echo "🚀 Local-Server-Site-Pusher Container Starting... [$STARTUP_TIME]"
```

### 4. Version Bump

Updated package.json from 1.1.3 to 1.1.5

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### For Portainer Users (Raspberry Pi / ARM64)

**This version WILL WORK with Portainer Git deployment!**

1. In Portainer: **Stacks → Add stack**
2. Build method: **Repository**
3. Repository URL: `https://github.com/spospordo/Local-Server-Site-Pusher`
4. Compose path: `docker-compose.portainer.yml`
5. **Deploy the stack**

Portainer will:
- Clone the repo on your Raspberry Pi
- Build with NO package-lock.json (excluded)
- npm will detect ARM64 platform
- Install correct linux-arm64 sharp binaries
- Start successfully! ✅

## 📦 Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile** - Updated npm install strategy, removed npm ci dependency
2. **package.json** - Version bump to 1.1.5
3. **.dockerignore** - Added package-lock.json to excluded files
4. **server.js** - Added timestamp and version to startup log
5. **docker-entrypoint.sh** - Added timestamp to container startup log
6. **CHANGELOG.md** - Documented v1.1.5 changes

## 🔧 Technical Explanation

### Why This Works

**Without package-lock.json:**
- npm install detects the actual build platform (ARM64)
- Fetches the latest compatible versions
- Downloads platform-appropriate binaries for sharp
- No locked x64 binaries to cause conflicts

**With npm rebuild:**
- Even if npm install had any issues, rebuild forces recompilation
- Uses local libvips-dev libraries (installed in step 3 of Dockerfile)
- Guarantees ARM64-native sharp binaries

### Why Previous Fixes Weren't Enough

- **v1.1.0-1.1.2**: Focused on npm install flags but didn't address package-lock.json
- **v1.1.3**: Added libvips-dev but package-lock.json still forced wrong binaries
- **v1.1.5**: Removes the root cause (platform-locked package-lock.json) ✅

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Container builds successfully on Raspberry Pi ARM64
- [x] Sharp module loads without errors
- [x] Server starts and listens on port 3000
- [x] No ARM64 runtime errors in logs
- [x] Portainer Git repository deployment works correctly
- [x] Timestamps visible in logs for debugging

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Version 1.1.5 definitively solves the ARM64 sharp module issue** by preventing platform-specific package locks from interfering with the Docker build process. The container will now build and run successfully on Raspberry Pi ARM64 when deployed via Portainer's Git repository method.
