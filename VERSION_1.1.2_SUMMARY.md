# Version 1.1.2 - ARM64 Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
Users deploying Local-Server-Site-Pusher to Raspberry Pi via Portainer (using "Add from Repository" feature) were encountering this error:

```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-arm64 runtime
Possible solutions:
- Ensure optional dependencies can be installed:
    npm install --include=optional sharp
```

This error persisted even after fixes in version 1.1.0 and 1.1.1.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Previous Attempts (v1.1.0 and v1.1.1)
- **v1.1.0**: Removed `--omit=dev` flag and added `--include=optional`
- **v1.1.1**: Added fallback logic `npm ci || npm install --include=optional`

These fixes improved the situation but didn't solve the problem for all deployment scenarios, specifically:
- Portainer Git repository builds on ARM64
- Fresh builds without cached layers
- Cross-platform package-lock.json files

### Why It Still Failed
The sharp npm package includes optional dependencies for platform-specific native bindings. While `npm install --include=optional` installs these dependencies, it doesn't always trigger the rebuild of native modules for the specific platform where the Docker image is being built.

When Portainer builds from a Git repository on Raspberry Pi:
1. npm installs the sharp package and its dependencies
2. However, it may use cached or pre-compiled binaries from package-lock.json
3. These binaries might not match the ARM64 platform
4. Result: Runtime error when sharp tries to load linux-arm64 bindings

## Solution (v1.1.2)

Added an explicit rebuild step for sharp in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Install dependencies including optional ones for platform-specific binaries (e.g., sharp for ARM64)
# Try npm ci first (faster), but fall back to npm install for better platform compatibility
# The --include=optional is critical for sharp's platform-specific binaries
RUN npm ci --include=optional || npm install --include=optional

# Explicitly rebuild sharp for the current platform architecture
# This ensures ARM64 binaries are correctly installed when building on Raspberry Pi
RUN npm rebuild sharp --verbose
```

### Why This Works

1. **npm ci/install**: Installs all dependencies including sharp
2. **npm rebuild sharp --verbose**: Forces sharp to:
   - Detect the current platform (ARM64 in this case)
   - Download or compile the correct native bindings for linux-arm64
   - Replace any incorrect binaries with the correct ones
   - Verbose output helps with debugging if issues occur

The explicit rebuild step ensures that regardless of what npm install does, sharp will be correctly configured for the platform where Docker is building the image.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dockerfile
**Added:** `RUN npm rebuild sharp --verbose` after npm install

### 2. package.json
**Updated:** Version from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

### 3. CHANGELOG.md
**Added:** Complete documentation of v1.1.2 changes with technical explanation

### 4. PORTAINER_ARM64_FIX.md
**Updated:** 
- Changed version reference from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
- Updated "The Fix" section with new rebuild step
- Updated verification section
- Added reference to verification script

### 5. DEPLOYMENT.md
**Updated:** Added note about v1.1.2 including explicit sharp rebuild

### 6. scripts/verify-arm64-sharp.sh (NEW)
**Created:** Verification script to help users confirm sharp is correctly installed for ARM64
- Detects system architecture
- Checks for ARM64-specific sharp binaries
- Tests sharp module loading
- Provides detailed feedback

## Testing & Verification

### For Users to Test
1. Deploy using Portainer "Add from Repository" feature
2. Check container logs - should NOT see sharp errors
3. Optionally run verification script:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-name> bash /app/scripts/verify-arm64-sharp.sh
   ```

### Expected Success Output
```
ðŸš€ Local-Server-Site-Pusher Container Starting...
...
âœ… Ownership correct for /app/uploads
ðŸ”„ Switching to user node...

> local-server-site-pusher@1.1.2 start
> node server.js

Local Server Site Pusher running on port 3000
```

No sharp module errors should appear.

## Technical Notes

### npm rebuild vs npm install
- **npm install**: Installs packages and may use pre-built binaries from registry
- **npm rebuild**: Forces recompilation/redownload of native modules for current platform
- **npm rebuild sharp**: Specifically rebuilds only the sharp module

### Platform Detection
Sharp's rebuild process:
1. Detects OS (linux)
2. Detects architecture (arm64)
3. Detects libc implementation (glibc from Debian base image)
4. Downloads/compiles appropriate binaries (@img/sharp-linux-arm64v8)

### Why --verbose Flag
The `--verbose` flag provides detailed output during the rebuild process, which helps:
- Confirm the correct platform is detected
- Show which binaries are being downloaded
- Debug any issues that occur during rebuild

## Deployment Instructions

### For Portainer on Raspberry Pi (Recommended Method)

Create a new stack in Portainer with:

```yaml
services:
  local-server:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/spospordo/Local-Server-Site-Pusher.git
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/config:/app/config
      - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/public:/app/public
      - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/uploads:/app/uploads
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This will:
1. Clone the repository (including v1.1.2 changes)
2. Build the Docker image on your Raspberry Pi
3. Run npm install with optional dependencies
4. Rebuild sharp for ARM64
5. Start the container successfully

## Files Modified

- `Dockerfile` - Added explicit sharp rebuild step

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented v1.1.2 changes
- `PORTAINER_ARM64_FIX.md` - Updated fix documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added v1.1.2 notes
- `scripts/verify-arm64-sharp.sh` - New verification script

## Success Criteria

âœ… Container builds successfully on Raspberry Pi
âœ… Sharp module loads without errors
âœ… Server starts and listens on port 3000
âœ… No ARM64 runtime errors in logs
âœ… Portainer deployment from Git repository works correctly
