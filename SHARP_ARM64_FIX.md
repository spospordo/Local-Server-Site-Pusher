# Sharp ARM64 Fix - Version 1.1.0

## Problem Summary
The container was failing to start on Raspberry Pi with the following error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-arm64 runtime
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile was using `npm ci --include=optional --omit=dev` which creates a conflict. The `--omit=dev` flag prevents npm from properly installing optional dependencies, including the platform-specific native bindings for the sharp image processing library on ARM64 platforms.

## Solution
**Changed in Dockerfile:**
- **Before:** `npm ci --include=optional --omit=dev` + `npm rebuild sharp`
- **After:** `npm ci --include=optional` (removed `--omit=dev` and the redundant rebuild step)

## What This Fixes
1. âœ… Sharp module now correctly installs with linux-arm64 native bindings during Docker build
2. âœ… No more runtime errors on Raspberry Pi
3. âœ… Cleaner build process (removed redundant npm rebuild command)

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Rebuild on Raspberry Pi
```bash
cd Local-Server-Site-Pusher
git pull
docker build -t local-server-site-pusher .
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Use the updated image (when published)
```bash
docker pull spospordo/local-server-site-pusher:latest
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Build with buildx for ARM64
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t local-server-site-pusher:arm64 .
```

## Verification
After deployment, you should see:
```
ðŸš€ Local-Server-Site-Pusher Container Starting...
ðŸ“§ Git is available for GitHub operations
...
âœ… Server started successfully on port 3000
```

No more sharp module errors!

## Technical Details
The `--omit=dev` flag tells npm to skip devDependencies, but in the process, it also interferes with the installation of optional dependencies that are platform-specific. Sharp uses optional dependencies to install the correct native bindings for each platform (linux-x64, linux-arm64, etc.). By removing `--omit=dev`, npm correctly identifies the platform and installs the appropriate sharp binaries during the build process.

Since this is a containerized application, we don't need to exclude devDependencies at the Docker build level - the production image doesn't need to be as lean as a direct Node.js deployment, and having the full dependency tree ensures compatibility.
