# Volume paths explanation:
# - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/config: Stores admin configuration and settings
# - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/public: Stores public web files
# - /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/uploads: Stores uploaded files from clients
#
# Before deploying, ensure these directories exist on your host:
# sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/{config,public,uploads}
# sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/local-server-site-pusher/
#
# Note: The container automatically fixes permissions if running as root initially
